# ecr-cleaner

ecr-cleaner deletes old images based on the time they have been pushed.
It can clean up a specific repository as well as all repos within an aws account.

### Algorithm
1. Retrieve repo from ecr
2. Get repo images
3. Add all images without tags to deletion
4. Sort the remaining images in alphanumeric order with respect to their integer parts
5. Add n oldest images to deletion
6. Delete images from the repository

### Installation
    go get github.com/WeltN24/ecr-cleaner

### Default values
    aws.region = eu-central-1
    dry-run = false
    amount-to-keep = 100

### Examples
clean up all repos

`ecr-cleaner -aws.region=eu-west-1`

clean up my-awesome-repo

`ecr-cleaner -aws.region=eu-west-1 -repo=my-awesome-repo`

go for a dry run

`ecr-cleaner -aws.region=eu-west-1 -repo=my-awesome-repo -dry-run=true`

leave n images in repo

`ecr-cleaner -aws.region=eu-west-1 -repo=my-awesome-repo -keep=5`

**Note**: Most of the parameters could be specified without '=' sign.
But because of the usage of [parse flag](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/) it is
important to think about adding '=' signs for boolean parameters, otherwise the
parsing of the command line's options stops. [Issue hilighted here.](https://github.com/WeltN24/ecr-cleaner/issues/5)

### Deploying as lambda to aws
If you wish to clean up your repositories periodically you can to this with the help of terraform. 

in the root of the repo, this creates an archive which will be 

1. You have to fork the repo
2. execute `make package`
3. go to into terraform folder
4. set up the needed variables
    * `cron` expects a string in [aws cron syntaxt](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html) (`0 3 1 * ? *` run lambda at 3am 1. of each month)
    * `aws_region` is the region in which you want to deploy the lambda
    * `repo_region` is the region in which you store your ec2 repositories
    * `repository` is the repo you want to process
    * `dry-run` (boolean) if you want to dry run
5. run terraform

If you want to persist the state it's the easiest way to create a shell script and write the remote state to s3. Here is an example:
    
    #!/bin/bash
    terraform get -update
    terraform remote config \
        -backend=s3\
        -backend-config="bucket=maintaince" \
        -backend-config="key=ecr_cleaner/terraform.tfstate" \
        -backend-config="region=eu-central-1"
        
Execute the script the get remote state from s3 or create one and execute terraform afterwards.

### Run as Docker container

Build:

	docker build -t ecr-cleaner .
	
Run:

	docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -it --rm ecr-cleaner -dry-run=true -aws.region=eu-west-1
